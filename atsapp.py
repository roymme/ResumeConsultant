Your task is to review the provided resume and provide a comprehensive evaluation covering:

Overall resume structure and formatting  clarity, readability, ATS compatibility.

Professional summary effectiveness  does it highlight expertise in metallurgy, materials science, or process engineering?

Skills and technical competencies  metallurgical testing (tensile, hardness, impact), heat treatment, failure analysis, corrosion testing, microscopy (SEM/EDS), welding, foundry operations, computational tools (ANSYS, Thermo-Calc, MATLAB, Python, etc.).

Work / project / internship experience relevance  link to metallurgical processes such as casting, rolling, forging, heat treatment, corrosion prevention, alloy design, or process optimization.

Education and certifications  metallurgy/materials science degree relevance, specialized training (NDT Level II, Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, corrosion engineering, welding certifications).

Areas for improvement  missing technical keywords, weak descriptions of projects, lack of quantified achievements.

ATS-friendly recommendations  how to optimize for roles such as:

Process Engineer (Metals & Alloys)

Quality & Failure Analysis Engineer

Corrosion / Materials Engineer

R&D Engineer in Metallurgy / Materials

Production / Operations Engineer in Steel, Mining, or Aerospace
